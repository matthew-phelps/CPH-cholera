#1 Model
## 1.1 Model structure  
We constructed a series of nested models with differing assumptions about the internal force of infection within a quarter ($\beta$) and the external force of infection between quarters ($\alpha$).  

From simple to complex we allowed (1) a single $\beta$ and single $\alpha$ for all quarters, (2) an individual $\beta_{i}$ for each quarter and a single $\alpha$ for all quarters, (3) an individual $\beta_{i}$ for each quarter and a single $\alpha_{i}$ for each quarter, (4) an individual $\beta_{i}$ for each quarter and single symmetric $\alpha_{j,i}$ for each quarter pair ($\alpha_{j,i} = \alpha_{i,j}$), (5) an individual $\beta_{i}$ for each quarter and a single asymmetric $\alpha_{i,j}$ for each quarter pair.  

Each model was based upon the following construction:
$$^{new}\textrm{I}_{i,t+1}\sim Poisson(\lambda_{i,t})$$
$$\lambda_{i,t} = \frac{S_{i,t}\phi}{N_{i}} (\beta_{i}I_{i,t} + \sum_{j\neq i}\alpha_{j,i}I_{j,t} )$$

where:  
$^{new}\textrm{I}_{i,t}$ = the number of new infectious cases in each quarter $i$ at time $t$  
$I_{i,t}$ = the total number of infectious cases in each quarter $i$ at time $t$  
$S_{i,t}$ = the number of susceptible people in each quarter $i$ at time $t$  
$N_{i}$ = the total poulation of quarter $i$  
$\beta_{i}$ = the force of internal infection in quarter $i$  
$\alpha_{j,i}$ = the force of infection from quarter $j$ to quarter $i$.  


The total number of cases $I_{i,t}$ was updated via:
$$I_{i,t+1} = I_{i,t} + \frac{^{new}\textrm{I}_{i,t}}{\phi} - R_{i,t}$$  
where:  
$\phi$ = the fraction of cases that are reported  
$R_{i,t}$ = the number of people who recovered or died from infection.

The number of recovered individuals $R_{i,t}$ was updated via:  
$$R_{i,t} = \frac{1}{\gamma} I_{i,t}$$
where:  
$\gamma$ = the average duration of infectiousness (fixed at 5 days).  

The number of suceptibles $S_{i,t}$ was updated via:
$$S_{i,t+1} = S_{i,t} - \frac{^{new}\textrm{I}_{i,t}}{\phi}$$
